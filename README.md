• objective :

The objective of the code is to create a simple To-Do List web application.

• key activities:

- User Input:
The user can enter text into the input field (<input type="text" id="input-box">) to describe a task they want to add to their to-do list.

- Adding a Task:
The user clicks the "Add" button, which triggers the addTask() function. This function collects the text entered by the user and appends it as a new list item (li) under the unordered list.

- Displaying Tasks:
The new task is displayed on the web page as an item in the list. The list updates dynamically each time a new task is added.
 
- Interactivity with Button:
The button (button onclick="addTask()") triggers the addTask() function when clicked, ensuring that tasks are added to the list.

• Technologies Used:

-HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Used for creating the basic structure of the web page, such as defining elements like headings, buttons, lists, and input fields.

-CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
External CSS file (https://secondtask.tiiny.site/style.css) is linked to style the webpage, controlling the visual presentation and layout of the page.

-JavaScript:
External JavaScript files (https://secondtask.tiiny.site/script.js and https://tiiny.host/ad-script.js) are included for interactive functionalities.
The JavaScript file handles the logic behind adding tasks to the to-do list, and possibly tracking user activity or showing advertisements.
External Analytics (Plausible Analytics):
