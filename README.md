• objective :

The objective of the code is to create a simple To-Do List web application.

• key activities:

- User Input:
The user can enter text into the input field (<input type="text" id="input-box">) to describe a task they want to add to their to-do list.

- Adding a Task:
The user clicks the "Add" button, which triggers the addTask() function. This function collects the text entered by the user and appends it as a new list item (li) under the unordered list.

- Displaying Tasks:
The new task is displayed on the web page as an item in the list. The list updates dynamically each time a new task is added.
 
- Interactivity with Button:
The button (button onclick="addTask()") triggers the addTask() function when clicked, ensuring that tasks are added to the list.

• Technologies Used:

-HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
HTML forms the structure of the page, defining the elements such as headings, buttons, and lists. It tells the browser what content to display and how it should be organized.

-CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS controls the look and feel of the page, such as the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.

-JavaScript:
JavaScript is used for adding interactivity to the webpage, like handling user input, manipulating content dynamically, and responding to user actions such as clicks or text input.
